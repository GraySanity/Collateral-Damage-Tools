				"This book is meant as a well -deserved change of pace of normal D&D. It is a big modification that changes most things one way or another. An attempt has been made to keep the general idea and foundation the same. Because of this, it is highly recommended to have played normal D&D at least a few times and know what you are doing before running this modified version, and it is even higherly recommended to read this Handbook first to find out what you can expect and how it differs from normal D&D. There will almost exclusively be changes from the original in this manual, and as few direct carbon copies of the original D&D Players Handbook as possible with the idea in mind that everything should be clear and understandable.",
				"This modification changed D&D into a hyper futuristic sci -fi setting with a giant mix of different fandoms and quite a lot of original stuff as well. It is meant to be played with as much freedom that you can give your players, especially in the character creation part. Most things in this manual are meant to be taken literally, and as the general ruleset. If a player thinks of something that the book doesn’t say can’t be done, than you can expect it to be a legal thing to do according to the rules except if the DM thinks it will ruin things completely. This is the general idea of this book, most things in this book are about examples of what can be done, or hard rules about what can’t be done.",
				"If you would DM this modification, than it is also highly recommended to read the DM manual for this as well as it explains the world and logic behind things in more depth. If you are going to DM this modified foundation in any setting, knowing the behind the scenes stuff and knowing the logic of how it is meant to deal with unconventional things is almost necessary, as quite some things and ideas of balancing depend on the DM being someone who knows what they are doing.",
				"Also, the unit system in this modification is the metric system. So distance is in meters, temperature in Kelvin or degrees Celsius, weight in kilogram, etc. ."],

Technically there are multiple multiverses, but I won’t go into that in the Player Handbook. The rest of this premise is about the main timestream.",

Most states have a love-hate relationship with them, as they actively try to keep the multiverse safe and because they improve technology most of which is fully free to read and use, but they also enforce a few rules on everyone, and they are a horrific force to be reckoned with. The IDPD gets most of its power because of its technology as the technology they personally use is far more advanced than any other. A reasonable fraction of the stuff they put out for everyone to use to make life easier and more sustainable is already too advanced for most civilizations to practically use. There is only one group which could be argued to be more powerful than IDPD which is called the Dark Brotherhood, and they have a good working relationship with the IDPD to the point of active and daily cooperation."],

For example, you have Advantage on a 3D4 damage roll. Than this would mean you roll 4D4 instead, and take the highest three numbers out of the four dice as your damage. If you have Advantage on a roll with multiple different dice, like 1D4+1D6, than this applies to both dice, letting your roll 2D4 and 2D6 taking the highest D4 and highest D6 roll.<br>If you have Advantage and Disadvantage on a roll, than these cancel each other out, letting you roll normally. If you have double Disadvantage and a single Advantage on a roll, than this negates one Disadvantage making you roll only one extra dice instead of two or three, and this applies to any amount of Advantages and Disadvantages on a roll of course."
